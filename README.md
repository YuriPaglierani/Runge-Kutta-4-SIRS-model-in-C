# Runge-Kutta-4-SIRS-model-in-C
Example of an integration method for a system of ordinary differential equations.

In this case we integrate the SIRS model, a non-linear system of 3 differential equations that describes an epidemic (I know, maybe now is not the right period to talk about epidemics) with the hypotesis of non-mortal virus (so the NÂ° of people is constant).

There are 3 main parameters: healthy, ill and resistant people.
